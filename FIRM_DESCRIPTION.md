# Firm Profile: Studio Reactive

## About
**Studio Reactive** is a multidisciplinary **Architecture and Design Technology Consultancy** that bridges the gap between physical design and advanced digital creation. We operate at the intersection of architectural practice, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, developing bespoke tools that empower designers and streamline complex workflows.

Our work is defined by a commitment to **toolmaking as a design practice**. We don't just use software; we build the next generation of creative tools for architects, fabricators, and artists.

## Core Pillars & Key Projects

### 1. AI & Design Intelligence
We are pioneering the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into the computational design ecosystem.
- **Grasshopper Logic Reader (`_GH_INTELLIGENCE`)**: A breakthrough toolkit that enables AI agents to "see" and "read" Grasshopper visual programming definitions. By parsing `.ghx` files, generating DeepZoom imagery, and mapping canvas coordinates, we allow AI to reason about graph logic, navigate complex scripts, and assist designers directly within their visual programming environment.

### 2. Grasshopper Ecosystem & Performance Tools
We develop robust plugins and utilities to enhance the Rhino/Grasshopper environment, focusing on performance optimization and fabrication workflows.
- **Bottleneck Buddy**: A comprehensive profiling tool for Grasshopper that helps users identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks. Features include component execution timing, rank-based highlighting, and performance comparison (current vs. baseline) to track regression during script development.
- **The "Buddy" Suite**: A collection of focused automation tools:
  - `DOGBONE BUDDY`: Automates CNC fabrication preparation (dogbones).
  - `NEST BUDDY`: Optimized nesting solutions for fabrication.
  - `VIEWPORT BUDDY`: Workflow enhancements for viewport management.

### 3. Application Development (Desktop & Mobile)
Our software engineering capabilities extend beyond plugins to standalone applications that solve specific industry problems.
- **WallSight (`FRAME-CALC`)**: An innovative mobile application concept for art installation. It combines AR (Augmented Reality) visualization with precise layout logic (thirds, fifths, offsets) to generate exact "cut-sheets" for hanging frames, bridging the gap between digital layout and physical installation.
- **Tone Splitter**: A standalone desktop application for screen printers and digital artists. It specializes in sophisticated color separation techniques, including custom halftone generation and index color separation, designed to prepare images for physical print processes.

### 4. Advanced Parametric Design
We continue to push the boundaries of geometric complexity in architecture.
- **Specialized Systems**: Projects like `CLASSIQ CONE`, `MOSAIQ`, and `STARFIELD` represent high-fidelity parametric modeling efforts, likely focused on complex surface rationalization, modular systems, or digital fabrication data generation.

## Technical Expertise
- **Design Intelligence**: Large Language Models, Agentic Workflows, Computer Vision.
- **Core Languages**: Python (Computational Geometry, AI, App Logic), C# (Rhino/Grasshopper Plugins), TypeScript/JavaScript (Web & Electron Apps).
- **Frameworks**: React, Electron, OpenCV, pyvips, RhinoCommon.
