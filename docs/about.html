            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Studio Reactive is an architectural design studio that combines creative vision with computational
                expertise to deliver exceptional built environments. We provide comprehensive architectural design
                services—from concept development and schematic design through construction documentation and
                fabrication
                coordination. Our work spans custom architectural elements, complex facades, sculptural installations,
                and signature interior features that define a space.</p>

            <p>Our design approach is grounded in advanced parametric modeling and digital fabrication methodologies.
                Using tools like Rhino 3D, Grasshopper, Revit, and CATIA, we develop geometrically sophisticated designs
                that are buildable, cost-conscious, and constructable. We work directly with fabricators and contractors
                to ensure design intent translates seamlessly into physical reality—whether the project involves
                CNC-milled
                components, 3D-printed elements, or precision-manufactured assemblies.</p>

            <p>Studio Reactive operates as a full-service design partner, offering visualization, rendering, and
                presentation support alongside core architectural services. We collaborate with architects, developers,
                and owners to realize ambitious design visions—providing the technical depth and execution capability
                to move projects from sketch to completion without compromise.</p>
